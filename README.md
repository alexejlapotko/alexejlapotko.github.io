- **Interactive Controls**: Click buttons to rotate cube faces (F, L, U, X, Y, Z)
- **Smooth Animations**: CSS3-powered transitions for fluid rotations
- **Color-Coded Faces**: Traditional Rubik's cube color scheme
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile browsers
- **Pure Vanilla JS**: No external dependencies required


## üìÅ Project Structure

The repository separates source files from generated assets so it's clear what should be edited versus what is produced by the build pipeline:

- `src/index.html` ‚Äì main HTML entry point that loads the module-based scripts
- `src/js/main.js` ‚Äì orchestrates cube rendering and button initialization
- `src/js/cube.js` ‚Äì JavaScript logic that renders and animates the cube
- `src/js/buttons.js` ‚Äì builds the rotation controls
- `src/styles/cube.css` ‚Äì authoring CSS before PostCSS processing
- `public/` ‚Äì compiled/static assets ready to be served (generated via `pnpm run build` and excluded from version control)


## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Prerequisites
- Modern web browser with CSS3 transform support
- Node.js and pnpm (for development and building)

### Quick Start
```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Build assets (required for first run, populates the git-ignored `public/` directory)
pnpm run build

# For development (watches CSS changes)
pnpm run dev

# Open the site (adjust for your OS)
open public/index.html         # macOS
# xdg-open public/index.html   # Linux
# start public\\index.html     # Windows PowerShell
```

### CSS Build Process
This project uses PostCSS with Autoprefixer for cross-browser compatibility:
- **Source**: `src/styles/cube.css` (modern CSS without vendor prefixes)
- **Build Output**: `public/styles/cube.css` (autoprefixed, minified, generated on demand)
- **Development**: Uses source CSS directly
- **Production**: GitHub Actions builds and deploys autoprefixed CSS
- **Features**: Automatic vendor prefixing for older browsers

### Available Scripts
```bash
# Development
pnpm run dev          # Watch CSS changes and rebuild automatically
pnpm run css:build    # Build CSS once
pnpm run css:watch    # Watch CSS changes (same as dev)

# Production
pnpm run build        # Build all assets for production

# Code Quality
pnpm run lint         # Lint JavaScript code
pnpm run lint:fix     # Auto-fix linting issues
pnpm run lint:check   # Check ESLint configuration
```
